Project Report: [Your Project Title]
1. Overview (10 points)
1.1 Background Information

Explain the context of your project.
Example:
This project was developed for the C++ Object-Oriented Programming course to demonstrate the use of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file handling, and other OOP principles.

1.2 Project Objectives

Classes and Objects

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism (virtual functions)

Abstraction

2.2 Other C++ Topics Used

Include anything relevant:

File handling

Vectors/arrays

Exception handling
